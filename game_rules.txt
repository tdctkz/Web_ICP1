The game can be played in one of the following modes:

(a) Simple game: The player who creates the first SOS is the winner. If no SOS is created when the board has been filled up, then the game is a draw. Turns alternate between players after each move.

(b) General game: The game continues until the board has been filled up. The winner is the player who made the most SOSs. If both players made the same number of SOSs, then the game is a draw. When a player succeeds in creating an SOS, that player immediately takes another turn and continues to do so until no SOS is created on their turn. Otherwise, turns alternate between players after each move.
